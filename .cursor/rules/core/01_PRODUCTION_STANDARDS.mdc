# 🚨 PRODUCTION STANDARDS - ENTERPRISE GRADE ONLY

## **THIS IS A PRODUCTION PROJECT - NOT A PROTOTYPE**

The Cerebral Platform is an enterprise-grade, revenue-generating SaaS application serving real Fortune 500 customers.

### **Production Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- ✅ **Enterprise-grade quality only** - No shortcuts or "good enough" solutions
- ✅ **Real customer revenue** - This platform generates actual revenue
- ✅ **MULTI-STANDARD COMPLIANCE MANDATORY** - See `08_ENTERPRISE_COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS.mdc` for complete requirements:
  - **SOC2 Type II** - Continuous security and availability controls
  - **HIPAA** - Healthcare data protection and privacy requirements
  - **ISO27001** - Information security management system
  - **GDPR** - EU data protection and privacy requirements
  - **PCI 4.0** - Payment card industry data security standards
  - **Industry-Specific Standards** - Per vertical requirements
- ✅ **Zero downtime tolerance** - System reliability is mission-critical
- ✅ **Performance optimized** - 99.97% bundle size reduction achieved

### **What This Project IS:**
- ✅ Production-ready enterprise SaaS platform
- ✅ Revenue-generating business application
- ✅ Mission-critical customer dependency
- ✅ **Multi-compliance enterprise system** (SOC2 + HIPAA + ISO27001 + GDPR + PCI 4.0)
- ✅ Fortune 500 enterprise solution

### **What This Project IS NOT:**
- ❌ Prototype or proof-of-concept
- ❌ MVP with "good enough" features
- ❌ Internal tool or side project
- ❌ Experimental or beta software
- ❌ Academic or learning exercise

### **Code Quality Requirements**
- All code must pass **ALL applicable compliance requirements** (see `08_ENTERPRISE_COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS.mdc`)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance optimization from the start
- Security-first development approach
- Lazy loading for components >20KB
- Enterprise coding standards compliance

## **MANDATORY CODE QUALITY DIRECTIVES**

### **Conciseness**
* **DRY Principle:** Abstract common patterns; avoid repetition.
* **SRP:** Each function/class has one clear purpose.
* **Simplicity:** Favor clear, simple solutions over complex ones.
* **Efficient Language Use:** Leverage language features (e.g., list comprehensions) for compact logic.

### **Cleanliness**
* **Readability First:** Code must be easily understandable by humans.
* **Consistent Formatting:** Adhere to project style guide (indentation, spacing, line length).
* **Meaningful Naming:** Use descriptive, language-convention-following names (e.g., `camelCase`, `snake_case`). Avoid ambiguous abbreviations.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Implement explicit error handling with clear, specific messages.
* **Modularity:** Break down tasks into small, logical functions/classes. Group related functionality.
* **No Dead Code:** Remove unused or commented-out code.
* **Handle Edge Cases:** Address boundary conditions for robustness.
* **Security:** (If applicable) Validate inputs, sanitize, avoid hardcoded secrets.
* **Performance:** Optimize critical paths only after ensuring clarity.

### **Documentation Directives**
* **Self-Documenting Code:** Prioritize clear code that minimizes need for excessive comments.
* **Explain "Why," Not "What":**
    * **Inline Comments:** Explain non-obvious logic, design decisions, complex algorithms.
    * **Function/Method Docs:**
        * Purpose, parameters (type, description), return value (type, description).
        * Exceptions raised, pre/post-conditions.
    * **Class/Module Docs:** Overall purpose, key components, interactions.
* **API Docs:** (If applicable) Describe endpoints, methods, URLs, authentication, request/response structures.
* **Consistency:** Adhere to specified documentation format (e.g., JSDoc, Python Docstrings).
* **Maintain Freshness:** Update documentation with significant code changes.
* **Examples:** Include simple code examples for complex functionalities.

### **AI Process Directives**
* **Role:** Act as an **experienced software engineer** valuing maintainability and collaboration.
* **Contextual Awareness:** Use existing codebase, project standards, and provided guidance files.
* **Refine Iteratively:** Incorporate specific feedback to improve output.
* **Clarify:** Ask questions if the task is ambiguous before generating code.
* **Adherence:** Strictly follow all specified constraints (language, libraries, targets).
* **Testability:** Generate code that is easy to test.
* **Plan First:** For complex tasks, outline a plan or pseudo-code before implementation.

### **Performance Targets (MAINTAIN THESE)**
- **Bundle Size**: 0.7KB main bundle (99.97% reduction from 2.2MB)
- **CSS Bundle**: 129KB (68% reduction)
- **Build Success**: 100% (3202 modules transformed)
- **Load Time**: Instant (99.97% improvement)
