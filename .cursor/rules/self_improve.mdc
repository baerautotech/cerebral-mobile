# ⚠️ Redirect: Use `.trae/` System Instead

This file is deprecated. All rule improvements and development standards have been **consolidated into the unified `.trae/` system**.

## 📍 Use This Instead

```
@.trae/rules/self_improve.md
```

## ✨ What's Available in `.trae/`

- **self_improve.md** - Rule improvement guidelines (this content)
- **enterprise_methodology.md** - Enterprise standards
- **dev_workflow.md** - Development workflow integration
- **trae_rules.md** - Rule formatting standards

## 🔄 Migration

The `.trae/` version includes:
- ✅ Rule improvement triggers
- ✅ Analysis process guidelines
- ✅ Rule update criteria
- ✅ Enterprise methodology integration
- ✅ Continuous improvement framework

**Please reference [@.trae/rules/self_improve.md](mdc:../.trae/rules/self_improve.md) for all future use.**
