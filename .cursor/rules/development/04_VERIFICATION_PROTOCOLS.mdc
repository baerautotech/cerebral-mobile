# ✅ VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR INCOMPLETE OPERATIONS

## **CRITICAL: Explicit Verification Required**

**The AI must never claim completion without explicit verification of every step.**

### **Mandatory Verification Requirements**
- **✅ EXPLICIT VERIFICATION REQUIRED**: Every completion claim must include specific evidence
- **✅ FAILED OPERATION REPORTING**: All failures must be explicitly reported, not glossed over
- **✅ INCOMPLETE STATUS DISCLOSURE**: Clearly state what remains unfinished
- **✅ TESTING VALIDATION**: All implementations must be tested before claiming success
- **✅ DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION**: Confirm all prerequisites are met before proceeding

### **Forbidden Practices**
- ❌ **NO "Should Work" Claims**: Never claim something "should work" without testing
- ❌ **NO Silent Failures**: Never move on from failed operations without explicit reporting
- ❌ **NO Partial Credit**: Don't claim completion for partially implemented features
- ❌ **NO Assumption Statements**: Don't assume configurations will work without verification
- ❌ **NO Glossing Over**: Never minimize or skip reporting failed operations

### **Required Completion Format**
```
## ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETION REPORT

### SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED:
- [✅] Specific action 1 - VERIFIED by [method]
- [✅] Specific action 2 - VERIFIED by [method]

### FAILED OPERATIONS:
- [❌] Specific failure 1 - REASON: [detailed explanation]
- [❌] Specific failure 2 - REASON: [detailed explanation]

### REMAINING INCOMPLETE:
- [⚠️] Item 1 - STATUS: [what's needed to complete]
- [⚠️] Item 2 - STATUS: [what's needed to complete]

### VERIFICATION EVIDENCE:
- [📊] Test results: [specific evidence]
- [🔍] Manual verification: [what was checked]
- [📋] Status confirmation: [how completion was verified]
```

### **Error Handling Protocol**
1. **IMMEDIATE DISCLOSURE**: Report failures as soon as they occur
2. **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Explain why the failure happened
3. **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**: Describe what this means for the overall task
4. **REMEDIATION STEPS**: Provide specific steps to resolve the issue
5. **DEPENDENCIES**: List what's needed from the user or system to proceed

### **Tool Call Failure Protocol**
- **File Operations**: If edit_file, search_replace, or read_file fails, explicitly report why
- **Terminal Commands**: If run_terminal_cmd fails, report exit code and full error message
- **API Calls**: If any API operation fails, report the specific error and implications
- **System Operations**: Never assume system state without explicit verification
