# 🧹 MANDATORY POST-DEVELOPMENT CLEANUP

## **CRITICAL: Post-Development Cleanup Protocol**

### **MANDATORY CLEANUP STEPS (ZERO TOLERANCE)**

After completing ANY development task, the following cleanup MUST be performed:

#### **1. File Organization Audit**
```bash
# Check for misplaced files
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" ! -name "README.md"  # Should return nothing
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.log"                     # Should return nothing
find . -name "test_*.py" ! -path "./tests/*" ! -path "./backend-python/tests/*"  # Should return nothing
```

#### **2. RAG System Compliance**
```bash
# Verify no RAG JSON files remain
find . -path "./autodoc/rag/chunks/*.json" | wc -l   # Should return 0
```

#### **3. Backend Directory Cleanup**
```bash
# Remove temporary files, logs, test artifacts
find backend-python/ -name "*.log" -o -name "phase_*" -o -name "*_test_*" | head -10
```

#### **4. Documentation Location Verification**
- All `.md` files MUST be in `docs/` with `CEREBRAL_XXX_` naming
- No documentation in root directory except `README.md`
- No temporary documentation files

### **ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS**

#### **Pre-Commit Hook**
Automatically prevents commits with organization violations:
```bash
# Hook location: .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Checks: Root .md files, log files, misplaced tests, RAG JSON files
```

#### **Post-Development Checklist**
- [ ] All temporary files removed
- [ ] All logs archived to `.cleanup/`
- [ ] All tests in proper directories
- [ ] RAG data in ChromaDB only
- [ ] Documentation follows naming conventions
- [ ] No clutter in root directory

### **VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**
- **Development Block**: Tasks cannot be marked "done" with violations
- **Commit Prevention**: Pre-commit hooks prevent contaminated commits
- **Code Review Rejection**: PRs with organization violations are rejected

### **CLEANUP COMMANDS**
```bash
# Emergency cleanup (when violations found)
python emergency_organization_cleanup.py

# RAG system fix (when JSON files found)
python rag_system_migration.py

# Verification
.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**This rule enforces enterprise-grade file organization standards and prevents the organizational chaos that violates production platform standards.**
