# 🎯 MASTER DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

**Status**: AUTHORITATIVE | **Priority**: P0 (MASTER RULE)
**Scope**: ALL documentation organization, naming, and file placement
**Effective**: November 5, 2025

---

## ⚠️ CONFLICT RESOLUTION NOTICE

This rule **SUPERSEDES and CONSOLIDATES** the following previously conflicting rules:
- ~~00_MANDATORY_DOCUMENTATION_NAMING_ENFORCEMENT.mdc~~ (DEPRECATED)
- ~~00_MANDATORY_FILE_ORGANIZATION_ENFORCEMENT.mdc~~ (DEPRECATED)
- ~~00_DOCUMENTATION_RULES_MEMORY_ALIGNMENT.mdc~~ (PARTS RETAINED)
- ~~FILE_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS.mdc~~ (PARTS RETAINED)
- ~~00_DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_STANDARD.mdc~~ (SUPERSEDED BY THIS)

**Why Consolidation Was Necessary:**
- 4 rules with same priority (00_) created undefined behavior
- Conflicting assumptions about root file placement
- Different naming schemes (CEREBRAL_XXX_ vs action-subject-scope)
- Different directory structures (flat vs hierarchical)
- Alphabetical load order created implicit precedence (wrong)

---

## 🎯 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

### **CORE PRINCIPLE: All Documentation → docs/ Directory**

**NO EXCEPTIONS** for AI-generated documentation:
- ✅ All `.md` files created by AI agents → `docs/`
- ✅ All planning documents → `docs/`
- ✅ All analysis → `docs/`
- ✅ All reports → `docs/`
- ❌ NOTHING documentation-related stays in root

### **Root Directory - Strict Allowlist ONLY**

The ONLY files permitted in repository root are:

```
README.md                    ← Project overview (permanent)
CLAUDE.md                    ← Cursor integration (auto-loaded)
.cursorrules                 ← Cursor config
.env / .env.example         ← Configuration files
pyproject.toml              ← Build config
package.json                ← Node config
Dockerfile                  ← Root service only
docker-compose.yml          ← Root only
Makefile / justfile         ← Build automation
.gitignore / .gitattributes ← Git configuration
LICENSE                     ← Legal
.cursor/                    ← Directory (Cursor config)
.git/                       ← Directory (Git)
.github/                    ← Directory (GitHub)
.mdc files in .cursor/rules/← Cursor rules
```

**CRITICAL**: No other `.md` files are permitted in root. PERIOD.

## 📋 HIERARCHICAL DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

All documentation MUST follow this hierarchical structure:

```
docs/
├── 00-QUICK-START/          # Getting started, rapid reference
│   ├── README.md
│   └── *.md
├── 01-DEPLOYMENT/           # CI/CD, build, deployment
│   ├── tekton/
│   ├── kubernetes/
│   └── *.md
├── 02-OBSERVABILITY/        # Monitoring, logging, tracing
│   ├── dashboards/
│   ├── alerts/
│   └── *.md
├── 03-SECURITY/             # Security policies, audit
│   ├── audit/
│   └── *.md
├── 04-OPERATIONS/           # Runbooks, troubleshooting
│   ├── runbooks/
│   ├── troubleshooting/
│   └── *.md
├── 05-ARCHITECTURE/         # Design, patterns, decisions
│   ├── microservices/
│   ├── data-layer/

│   └── historical-reports/  # Old reports
└── README.md                # Navigation hub
```

## 📝 NAMING CONVENTION

All documentation files MUST follow this pattern:

```
{action}-{subject}-{scope}-{date}.md

Components:
  action  = What kind of doc (plan, guide, report, audit, runbook, etc.)
  subject = Main topic (cleanup, deployment, security, performance, etc.)
  scope   = What it covers (backend, mobile, platform, microservices, etc.)
  date    = YYYY-MM-DD (optional but recommended for reports)
```

### **Examples**

✅ CORRECT:
- `cleanup-plan-directory-structure-2025-11-05.md`
- `runbook-incident-response-api-gateway.md`
- `audit-report-soc2-compliance-2025-q4.md`
- `guide-database-migration-kubernetes.md`
- `dashboard-performance-metrics-platform.md`

❌ INCORRECT:
- `FINAL_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` (all caps, no structure)
- `phase1.md` (too vague)
- `report.md` (no context)
- `CEREBRAL_001_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` (numbered scheme - DEPRECATED)

## 🚀 PLACEMENT DECISION TREE

When creating documentation:

```
Is this AI-generated content?
├── YES → Goes to docs/
│   ├── What category? (01-07)
│   ├── What subcategory?
│   ├── Proper naming: action-subject-scope.md
│   └── ✅ CREATE IN docs/{category}/{subcategory}/
│
└── NO → Check allowlist
    ├── Is it in root allowlist? (README, .env, etc.)
    │   └── YES → Keep in root
    └── Is it a Cursor rule?
        └── YES → Goes to .cursor/rules/
```

---

## ⚙️ ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### **Pre-Creation Checklist (MANDATORY)**

Before creating ANY documentation file, verify:

```
□ Is this AI-generated documentation?
□ If YES: Does it go in docs/ with proper organization?
□ Have I identified the correct category (01-07)?
□ Have I identified the correct subcategory?
□ Is my filename following action-subject-scope pattern?
□ Have I updated docs/README.md with navigation link?
□ Am I about to create in root? → STOP, move to docs/
□ Is this in my allowlist? → Exception allowed
```

### **Git Commit Validation**

Commits MUST follow this pattern:

```
✅ CORRECT:
  docs: Add cleanup plan to 05-ARCHITECTURE

✅ CORRECT:
  docs: Create incident response runbook for API gateway

❌ INCORRECT:
  docs: Add FINAL_CLEANUP_PLAN.md  (no structure)

❌ INCORRECT:
  Added documentation in root (violates standard)
```

### **Root File Validation**

Any `.md` file found in root MUST:
1. Match the allowlist (README.md, CLAUDE.md only)
2. Be a Cursor rule file (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)
3. Have explicit user approval

**VIOLATION**: File found in root → IMMEDIATELY MOVE to docs/

## 🔄 LEGACY DIRECTORY CONSOLIDATION

### **Current Situation**

This rule was created November 5, 2025 to define the **ideal future state** of documentation organization.

However, the `docs/` directory currently contains **~90 directories** accumulated over months of ad-hoc organization. This consolidation plan maps all legacy directories to the new structure.

### **Consolidation Mapping**

See: `docs/DOCS-CONSOLIDATION-MAPPING.md` for complete mapping of:
- All 90 current directories → new 01-07 + archive structure
- Which directories to merge
- Which directories to move
- Which directories to deprecate
- Step-by-step bash commands for reorganization

### **Quick Summary: 90 → 15**

| From | To | Result |
|------|-----|--------|
| 90 scattered dirs | 8 categories + archive (15 total) | 83% reduction |
| Multiple overlapping dirs | Single canonical location | No more conflicts |
| Unclear hierarchy | Clear category-based organization | Easy navigation |

### **Timeline**

1. **Phase 1** (Immediate): Start directing NEW files to correct locations
2. **Phase 2** (Week 1): Consolidate legacy directories using provided mappings
3. **Phase 3** (Ongoing): Migrate files to new locations as they're accessed
4. **Phase 4** (Complete): All 90 → 15, clean structure, no legacy dirs

---

## 🔄 MIGRATION RULES

### **For Existing Root Files**

If a documentation file currently exists in root:

```
1. Determine its category (01-07)
2. Rename it: action-subject-scope-date.md
3. Move to: docs/{category}/{subcategory}/
4. Update docs/README.md with navigation
5. Commit: "docs: Reorganize {filename} to {new-path}"
```

### **For Active Work Files (CAEF, ATOMIC, SRP)**

Previously, these were kept in root for "active work" distinction:
- ~~CAEF_*.md~~ → `docs/implementation-archive/` (when complete)
- ~~ATOMIC_*.md~~ → `docs/implementation-archive/` (when complete)
- ~~SRP_*.md~~ → `docs/05-ARCHITECTURE/` (ongoing)

**New approach**: Even active work goes to docs/ in appropriate category.

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After implementing this standard, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check no .md files in root except allowlist
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | grep -v README.md | grep -v CLAUDE.md
# Should return: (nothing)

# 2. Check all docs follow naming convention
find docs -name "*.md" | grep -E "_" | head -5
# Look for hyphens (good) not underscores (bad)

# 3. Check proper categorization
find docs -maxdepth 1 -type d | sort
# Should show: 00-QUICK-START, 01-DEPLOYMENT, ... 07-REFERENCE, archive

# 4. Check docs/README.md has navigation
grep -c "^##" docs/README.md
# Should have multiple section headers

# 5. Verify no stray .md files in random directories
find . -path ./node_modules -prune -o -name "*.md" -type f | \
  grep -v "docs/" | grep -v ".cursor/" | grep -v ".git/" | \
  grep -v root_allowed_files
# Should only show allowlist files
```

---

## 🚨 VIOLATION RESPONSE

If a violation is detected:

```
1. STOP current task
2. IDENTIFY violating file(s)
3. MOVE to correct location (docs/ category/subcategory)
4. RENAME to correct pattern (action-subject-scope.md)
5. UPDATE docs/README.md
6. COMMIT with clear message
7. CONTINUE
```
