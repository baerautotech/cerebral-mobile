## Error Accumulation Prevention

### **Root Cause Analysis Required**
When implementing features that generate linting errors:
- Identify WHY the errors are occurring (configuration, coding patterns, tool conflicts)
- Fix configuration issues before fixing individual errors
- Document systemic patterns in team knowledge base

### **Correlation Monitoring**
- Weekly correlation analysis between TypeScript and ESLint errors
- Alert on files with both error types growing simultaneously
- Investigate files with >50 combined errors for architectural issues

### **Configuration Synchronization**
- Keep TypeScript exclude patterns and ESLint ignore patterns synchronized
- Use unified configuration management for both tools
- Test configuration changes against representative file samples

### **Quality Gates**
- Block commits that add >10 TypeScript errors to any file
- Require explanation for adding files to exclude lists
- Mandate correlation analysis for major linting rule changes

### **Team Coordination**
- Share knowledge of common error patterns and their fixes
- Document successful mass-fix strategies for future reference
- Coordinate linting rule changes across team members
