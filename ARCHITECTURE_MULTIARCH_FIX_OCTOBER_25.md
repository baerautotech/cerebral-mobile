# 🏗️ Multi-Architecture Base Images Fix - October 25, 2025

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Impact**: 🔴 BLOCKING ISSUE → ✅ RESOLVED  
**Timeline**: ~17 minutes (both images built and deployed)

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Base images were built on Mac (ARM64) but Kubernetes cluster requires AMD64 images. This caused all Kaniko builds to fail with "no matching manifest for linux/amd64" error.

**Solution**: Rebuilt both base images using `docker buildx` to create multi-architecture manifests that support both AMD64 (cluster) and ARM64 (Mac development).

**Result**: Both `cerebral/ai-base:cuda` and `cerebral/ai-base:cpu` now support both architectures. Kaniko builds can proceed successfully.

---

## Issue Details

### What Happened

1. **October 24**: Built base images locally on Mac using `docker build`
   - Result: ARM64-only images (Mac's native architecture)
   
2. **October 24**: Pushed to internal registry (10.34.0.202:5000)
   - Images uploaded as ARM64-only
   
3. **October 25**: Attempted PipelineRun in Kubernetes cluster
   - Kaniko tried to pull base image
   - Registry returned ARM64 manifest
   - AMD64 cluster couldn't run ARM64 image
   - Error: "no matching manifest for linux/amd64"
   - **Build failed** 🔴

### Root Cause

Mac's `docker build` command produces ARM64 images by default (Apple Silicon). This is the correct architecture for local development on Mac, but **incompatible with the AMD64 Kubernetes cluster**.

### Impact

- ❌ All Kaniko builds blocked
- ❌ PipelineRuns failing immediately
- ❌ Services cannot deploy
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline non-functional

---

## Solution Implemented

### Step 1: Identified Solution

Used `docker buildx` instead of `docker build`:
- `docker buildx` can build for multiple architectures simultaneously
- Supports creating manifest lists (OCI Index)
- Automatically resolves correct image by architecture

### Step 2: Rebuilt CUDA Image

```bash
cd ~/Development/cerebral

docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -f docker/Dockerfile.ai-base.cuda \
  -t 10.34.0.202:5000/cerebral/ai-base:cuda \
  --push .
```

**Result**:
- Built for AMD64 (2 minutes)
- Built for ARM64 (0.7 minutes, cached)
- Total time: ~2.7 minutes
- Manifest digest: `sha256:bd09126450be105ea3dca4fb8f2711bf602992ecf3736c7cfd2b62d3b210f387`

### Step 3: Rebuilt CPU Image

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -f docker/Dockerfile.ai-base.cpu \
  -t 10.34.0.202:5000/cerebral/ai-base:cpu \
  --push .
```

**Result**:
- Built for AMD64 (depends on pip packages)
- Built for ARM64 (0.7 minutes, cached)
- Total time: ~14 minutes (pip install dependencies)
- Manifest digest: `sha256:5dc0e85248ef3f30d8c8bf82208414441ba47855f5316a29d46ff6b674bc49b9`

### Step 4: Verified in Registry

```bash
curl -s http://10.34.0.202:5000/v2/cerebral/ai-base/manifests/cuda \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json" | \
  jq '.manifests[] | select(.platform.architecture != "unknown") | .platform.architecture'

# Output:
# "amd64"
# "arm64"
```

## Current Registry State

### cerebral/ai-base:cuda

```
Manifest List (OCI Index)
├── linux/amd64
│   └── sha256:bb4720105236... (for Kubernetes cluster)
└── linux/arm64
    └── sha256:98f048d8d1af... (for Mac development)
```

### cerebral/ai-base:cpu

```
Manifest List (OCI Index)
├── linux/amd64
│   └── sha256:3404fabca4ed... (for Kubernetes cluster)
└── linux/arm64
    └── sha256:74428da7c660... (for Mac development)
```

## How Multi-Architecture Resolution Works

```
Developer requests image:
  docker pull 10.34.0.202:5000/cerebral/ai-base:cuda

Registry responds:
  OCI Manifest Index with multiple architectures
  [
    {architecture: "amd64", digest: "..."},
    {architecture: "arm64", digest: "..."}
  ]

Docker/Kaniko:
  1. Detects own architecture (amd64 or arm64)
  2. Finds matching manifest in index
  3. Pulls correct architecture
  4. SUCCESS ✅

Result:
  • Mac gets: ARM64 image
  • Kubernetes gets: AMD64 image
  • Same tag, automatic resolution
  • Zero configuration needed
```

## Prevention for Future

### Best Practices

✅ **ALWAYS use multi-platform builds:**
```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -f Dockerfile \
  -t registry/image:tag \
  --push .
```

❌ **NEVER use single-architecture docker build:**
```bash
# This only builds for Mac's architecture!
docker build -f Dockerfile -t registry/image:tag .
```

### Commands for Future Rebuilds

**If updating base images:**

1. Edit shared dependencies:
   ```bash
   vim ~/Development/cerebral/docker/requirements-unified.txt
   ```

2. Build BOTH architectures:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
     -f docker/Dockerfile.ai-base.cuda \
     -t 10.34.0.202:5000/cerebral/ai-base:cuda --push .
   ```

3. Verify both architectures:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://10.34.0.202:5000/v2/cerebral/ai-base/manifests/cuda \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json" | \
     jq '.manifests[] | .platform.architecture'
   ```

4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add docker/
   git commit -m "chore: Update base images (multi-arch)"
   git push origin main
   ```
