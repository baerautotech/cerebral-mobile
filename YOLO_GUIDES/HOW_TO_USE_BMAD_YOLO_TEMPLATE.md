# 🎯 How to Use the BMAD YOLO Standard Template

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide to apply the BMAD YOLO template to YOUR project  
**Audience**: Project managers, architects, technical leads  
**Time**: 2-3 hours to apply template to your project  
**Result**: Your project ready for 99%+ autonomous execution  

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### The Template Does This:

```
Your Project Documentation
         ↓
   BMAD Template
         ↓
Complete YOLO System (65-75 hours prep)
         ↓
99%+ Accuracy Autonomous Execution
```

### To Apply It:

1. Read: `BMAD_YOLO_STANDARD_TEMPLATE.md` (15 min)
2. Extract: Your project context (30-60 min)
3. Validate: All 10 context categories complete (20-30 min)
4. Plan: Your 65-hour implementation (30 min)
5. Execute: Follow the template (65 hours)

---

## Step-by-Step Application

### Step 1: Understand the Template (15-30 minutes)

**Read sections in this order:**

1. **Overview** - Understand BMAD method + success metrics
2. **Phase 1: BMAD Planning** - Understand context extraction (this is critical)
3. **Perfect Context Extraction Prompt** - This is THE key section
4. **Gap Analysis & Validation** - Understand what "complete" means
5. **Phase 2: YOLO Preparation** - Understand implementation timeline
6. **Implementation Checklist** - See what comes next

**Key Insight**: The template is a PROCESS, not a document. It's a workflow to transform your project.

### Step 2: Extract Your Project Context (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Complete all 10 context categories from the template

**How to do it:**

1. **Read the Perfect Context Extraction Prompt**
   - It's in `BMAD_YOLO_STANDARD_TEMPLATE.md`
   - It's specifically engineered to pull all needed context
   - It ensures NO GAPS

2. **Gather your project documentation:**
   - SCRUM breakdown (epics, stories, SP)
   - Architecture decision records
   - Phase definitions
   - Risk register
   - Technical specifications
   - API documentation
   - Previous lessons learned

3. **Use the prompt to extract context:**
   - Copy the "Perfect Context Extraction Prompt" section
   - For your project, fill in EACH of the 10 categories
   - If you can't complete a category → STOP and gather more info
   - DO NOT skip categories (no gaps policy)

4. **Create these files (one per project):**
   - `YOUR_PROJECT_INTAKE.md` (project fundamentals)
   - `YOUR_PROJECT_ERROR_SCENARIOS.yaml` (all error scenarios)
   - `YOUR_PROJECT_PHASE_MAP.yaml` (phase breakdown)
   - `YOUR_PROJECT_PHASE_GATES.yaml` (gates + criteria)
   - `YOUR_PROJECT_TEST_STRATEGY.yaml` (testing)
   - `YOUR_PROJECT_DEPENDENCIES.yaml` (cross-phase)
   - `YOUR_PROJECT_RISKS.md` (technical risks)

### Step 3: Run Gap Analysis (30-60 minutes)

**Use the Gap Analysis Checklist from the template:**

```
Go through each of 8 categories:
1. Scope completeness
2. Architecture completeness
3. Error scenario completeness
4. Testing completeness
5. Gate completeness
6. Dependency completeness
7. Risk completeness
8. Team completeness

For EACH: Answer yes/no for each checkmark
If ANY answer is "no" → You have a gap
If gaps exist → GO BACK and fill them in (no gaps policy)
```

**If gaps found:**
- Document which category
- Document what's missing
- Go back to your team
- Gather missing information
- Fill in the gap
- Re-run gap analysis

**If NO gaps found:**
- ✅ You're ready for 65-hour implementation
- Create a "READY FOR YOLO" document
- Sign off with team
- Schedule implementation time

### Step 4: Plan Your 65-Hour Implementation (30-60 minutes)

**Use Phase 2 and Implementation Checklist:**

Choose your implementation approach:

**Option A: Intensive 4-Day Sprint (Best)**
```
Day 1: Hours 0-24 (Phases 1-3 prep)
  - 8h: Error scenarios
  - 8h: Integration tests
  - 8h: Framework + gates
  
Day 2: Hours 24-48 (Phases 4-6 prep)
  - 8h per phase prep
  
Day 3: Hours 48-65 (Phases 7-9 + cross-phase)
  - 5h per phase
  - 20h cross-phase
  
Result: Ready to execute in 4 days
```

**Option B: Weekly Implementation (Pragmatic)**
```
Week 1: Hours 0-24 (Phases 1-3 prep)
Week 2: Hours 24-48 (Phases 4-6 prep)
Week 3: Hours 48-65 (Phases 7-9 + cross-phase)

Result: Ready in 3 weeks, but more time to think
```

**Option C: Concurrent Execution + Prep (Smart)**
```
Week 1-2: Phases 1-3 prep + execute Phase 1-2
Week 3-4: Phases 4-6 prep + execute Phase 3
Week 5-6: Phases 7-9 prep + execute Phase 4+

Result: Rolling execution, continuous prep
Timeline: Slower delivery but learning as you go
```

**Create an implementation plan document:**
```
MY_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

Approach: [Choose A/B/C]
Start Date: [When]
End Date: [When]
Team Capacity: [Hours/day available]
Milestones: [Day 1, Day 2, etc.]
Review Points: [When to check progress]
```

### Step 5: Execute 65-Hour Implementation (65 hours over 1-7 days)

**Follow Phase 2 from the template EXACTLY:**

For EACH phase:
1. Create error scenario YAML
2. Create integration tests
3. Create phase gate
4. Create edge case documentation
5. Create handler code
6. Commit to git with good message

**Deliverables after 65 hours:**
- ✅ Complete YOLO blueprint (500+ lines)
- ✅ Engineering blueprint (300+ lines)
- ✅ Decision framework (200+ lines)
- ✅ Error scenario handlers (code)
- ✅ Integration test suites (code)
- ✅ CI/CD automation
- ✅ Perfect sprint prompts (9 if 9 phases)
- ✅ Gap analysis system
- ✅ Repair findings system

### Step 6: Validate & Deploy (1 day)

**Pre-Execution Checklist:**
- [ ] All files committed to git
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] All gates defined
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working
- [ ] Team trained on system
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Approval from leadership

**Then: START EXECUTION** 🚀

## Common Questions About the Template

### Q1: "Do I have to do ALL 65 hours?"

**A**: YES. Here's why:

```
Pure YOLO (0h prep):       79% accuracy → fails
Guided YOLO (24h prep):    91% accuracy → meets target
Complete YOLO (65h prep):  99%+ accuracy → exceeds target
```

Each hour prepares a different aspect. Skipping hours = missing that aspect = accuracy drops.

**However**: You can spread 65 hours over time (4 days, 3 weeks, rolling).

### Q2: "What if my project is smaller?"

**A**: Scale the template:

```
Template assumes: 9 phases, 137 stories
Your project:    3 phases, 30 stories

Scaling:
  Error scenarios:      30% of template
  Integration tests:    30% of template
  Phase gates:          3 instead of 9
  Edge cases:           Proportional
  Implementation time:  15-25 hours instead of 65h
```

**Formula**: (Your Stories / 137) × 65 hours = Your Implementation Time

### Q3: "What if my project has no phases?"

**A**: Define phases:

```
Monolithic project → Break into logical phases:
  Phase 1: Foundation/Infrastructure
  Phase 2: Core Features
  Phase 3: Integration
  Phase 4: Optimization
  Phase 5: Production Hardening
```

Each phase is ~2-3 weeks of execution. Template works for any phase structure.

### Q4: "Can I use this for an existing project?"

**A**: YES! Use it to prepare for the NEXT phase:

```
Project executing Phase 3
  ↓
Apply template to remaining Phases 4-9
  ↓
Prepare while executing
  ↓
No surprises ahead
```

### Q5: "What if I find a gap?"

**A**: Stop and fix it:

```
TEMPLATE: No gaps policy

Gap found → Must resolve before implementation
Why? Because gaps = unknown unknowns = 99% accuracy impossible

Resolution:
  1. Document the gap
  2. Gather missing information
  3. Fill in the gap
  4. Re-run gap analysis
  5. Confirm 0 gaps
  6. Then proceed
```
